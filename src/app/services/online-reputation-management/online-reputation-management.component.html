        <p>ORM or online reputation management demonstrates observing, tending to, or moderating SERPs. SERPs refer to
            Search Engine Result Pages. This can also direct to various mentions of a company or brand in online media
            and Web content. An organization must understand how people on the Internet perceive them online.</p>

        <p>People nowadays look for reviews online all the time. Consumers may not lean on you entirely if your brand

            that if you have good SEO on your website, people can find you online easily.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, online reputation management is what people have written about you online. ORM shapes a
            consumer&rsquo;s thought procedure based on the facts known online about your company.</p>
